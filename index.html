Strengthen healthcare workers and first responders, who selflessly serve on the front lines of this crisis. Comfort those who are sick and their loved ones, and bring healing to all who are afflicted.</h3>
    <h4 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #333;">In the face of isolation and loneliness, may we feel Your presence, connecting us to one another in solidarity and compassion.
